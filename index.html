        <p>While the debate over mandated "vaccine passports" rages on, a growing number of employers, businesses and venues are demanding proof of vaccination. That's making it increasingly important for workers and customers to carry documentation that can be whipped out whenever the need arises.

          Here are some suggestions to ensure that vaccinated people are always covered.</p>

        <h2>Old-fashioned paper cards</h2>
<p>Everyone who gets at least one inoculation gets one of these paper cards from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, at 4-by-3 inches they are larger than the average wallet, which means they're bound to suffer some abuse. The good news is they can be easily protected from everyday wear and tear with a little extra care.

Along the same lines, there are lots of functional and/or cute vaccination card holders for safekeeping.</p>

        <h6>By NYT</h6>
        <p>Serious coronavirus infections among vaccinated people have been relatively rare since the start of the vaccination campaign, a New York Times analysis of data from 40 states and Washington, D.C., shows. Fully vaccinated people have made up as few as 0.1 percent of and as many as 5 percent of those hospitalized with the virus in those states, and as few as 0.2 percent and as many as 6 percent of those who have died.</p>

<p>There is still a lot we do not know about so-called breakthrough infections â€” when fully inoculated people contract the virus. And there is some evidence that these cases are becoming more common as the more transmissible Delta variant surges. While vaccines have done a remarkable job at protecting a vast majority of people from serious illness, the data in the Times analysis generally spanned the period from the start of the vaccination campaign until mid-June or July, before the Delta variant became predominant in the United States.</p>

        <p>The Justice Department and New Jersey have reached an agreement to implement a series of reforms to better protect inmates from sexual abuse by staff at a notorious women's prison, officials announced Tuesday.</p>
        <p>If approved by a federal judge, the agreement would implement new policies at the Edna Mahan Correctional Facility such as confidential reporting methods for sexual abuse and improved measures to hold staff accountable. An independent monitor would oversee and assess the state's compliance with the agreement.</p>
